"""Tests for the command-line interface of the commit tool.

Use this file to check that your CLI behaves correctly for common
invocations.
"""

# Hints:
# - You can call your CLI via `subprocess.run` or via a library like
#   `click.testing` / `typer.testing` if you use those frameworks.
# - Useful tests include:
#   - `ai-commit --help` exits with code 0 and shows usage text.
#   - Invalid options are handled gracefully (non-zero exit + message).
#   - `--dry-run` prints a message but does not run `git commit`.
