"""Tests for git-related helper functions.

These tests should verify that your `git_utils` module behaves correctly
when interacting with real or temporary git repositories.
"""

# Hints:
# - Consider using `tmp_path` or `tempfile` to create a temporary repo
#   for tests, then run `git init`, create files, and stage changes.
# - Verify that your helper for getting the staged diff returns a string
#   and that it reflects the changes you staged.
# - Also test error cases, such as running outside a git repository.
