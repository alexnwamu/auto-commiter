"""Simple logging configuration for the project.

This file should provide a small, centralized way to configure logging
for your CLI tool so you can easily turn debug information on or off.
"""

# Hints:
# - You can use the standard `logging` module to set a global log level
#   and format (e.g. INFO, DEBUG).
# - Consider exposing a `setup_logging(level: str | None = None)` helper
#   that the CLI calls once at startup.
# - You might read the desired log level from an environment variable or
#   a CLI flag (e.g. `--verbose`).
